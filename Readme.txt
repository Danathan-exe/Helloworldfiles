What could you use Github for?

You caqn use it to share cool projects you think up of or just to share ideas with friends!

What is a compiler?

a program that converts human text into something the computer can read

Why did you have to compile your C code but not your BASH and Python3 code?

Python3 has a built in compiler while C does not. python is easily read by the system while C is not.

For this Project I created the files Myself seen by the youtube link above

run git clone https://github.com/Danathan-exe/Helloworldfiles    to get the files i did on your aws mechine

then cd into the folder that it created. 

cd ~/Helloworldfiles

then, you will need to do some special steps in order to rin the C script.

First, you need to do sudo apt update && upgrade tlo ensure your system is up to date.

Afer you have updated the system you will need to get GCC which is a script compiler.


sudo apt install gcc

once you have gcc you can run 


gcc -o Helloworld Helloworld.C

that should create a script to run now run the following:

./Helloworld

you now will have run Hello world on C.

ON BASH:

its pretty simple first run chmod

chmod +x helloworld.sh

then:
 ./helloworld.sh

you have now run Hello world on bash

ON PYTHON:

most linux systems have python on them but if not you will need to downlod it.

next its super simple you just need to run the following command 

python3 helloworld.py

and now you have successfully ran helloworld on 3 diffrent languages.

this will be on the readme on the github site.
